    <h1>Salade Lyonnaise</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic bistro salad hails from the colunary capital of Fraqnce: Lyon. It is the contrasts in taste and texture that can make a meal of a salad. The soft yolk from the poached egg melds with the vinaigrette creating a richness that coats the bitter frisée greens, and the crunchy croutons balance the intensity of the smokey “lardons”. Frisée has a frilly leaf that catches the dressing, and its slightly bitter character stands up to the bacon. If you can’t find frisée, use Belgian endive, arugula or escarole.</p>

  <h3>Ingridients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> ½ lb (225 g) double smoked bacon</li>
    <li> ½ baguette, cut in 1-inch (2.5 cm) dice</li>
    <li> 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil</li>
    <li> 1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li> Salt and pepper</li>
    <li> 4 large eggs</li>
    <li> 1 Tbsp (15 mL) white wine vinegar</li>
    <li> 4 cups (1 L) frisée lettuce, trimmed, washed and cut in bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li> ¼ cup (60 mL) Red Wine Vinaigrette</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vinaigrette Ingridients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> ¼ cup (60 mL) red wine vinegar</li>
    <li> 1/2 shallot, minced</li>
    <li> 2 Tbsp (30 mL) finely chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    <li> 1 tsp (5 mL) Dijon mustard</li>
    <li> 2/3 cup (160 mL) extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> Salt and pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the bacon into “batons”—small sticks that are 2 x ¼ inches (5 cm x 6 mm). Bring a small saucepot of water to a rolling boil over high heat and drop in the bacon to blanch for 1 minute and then drain (this will remove salt from the bacon and make it firm to the bite). Heat a sauté pan over medium heat, add the blanched bacon and sauté until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towel.</li>
    <li>For the toasted baguette, preheat the oven to 350F (180C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the diced baguette in a large bowl with the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Arrange the baguette on the prepared baking sheet and toast until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Both of these steps and making the vinaigrette can be completed ahead of time.</li>
    <li>For the poached eggs, bring 4 cups (1 L) water to a gentle boil over medium-high heat in a medium saucepot. Add the vinegar and reduce to a simmer, so that bubbles barely break the surface of the water. Stir with a spoon to create a cyclone effect in the water. Crack an egg into a small dish, and then gently tip the dish into the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs, dropping them in one at a time, and cooking until the white is firm but the yolk is still runny, about 3 minutes. Gently lift each egg from the water using a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain.</li>
    <li>To serve, dress the frisée lettuce with the red wine vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper, and arrange on individual plates. Sprinkle the cooked bacon overtop. Arrange the croutons and top with the poached eggs.</li>
